## Inspiration
According to the USDA, it's estimated that between 30-40% of the food supply in the U.S. is wasted each year!! Have you seen all the donuts that Dunkin' Donuts dumps into the trash???

With such a staggering amount of food waste, it's no wonder that some people have turned to dumpster diving as a way to combat this issue. By salvaging perfectly good food that would otherwise go to waste, dumpster divers are able to save money on groceries, reduce their environmental impact, and make use of resources that have already been produced.

## What it does
Dumpster Diving Diners is an online platform that provides insights to dumpster diving enthusiasts on how to optimize their experiences. The website hosts informative articles, detailing various tips and tricks for navigating the often unchartered waters of dumpster diving. Additionally, the platform features a user-friendly Google map, compiled through the collective wisdom of crowdsourcing, pinpointing prime locations for dumpster diving expeditions. For those who seek further guidance or wish to share their own perspectives on the topic, the website offers a convenient contact section, providing a forum for communication and the exchange of ideas.

## How we built it
The framework was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS, resulting in a dynamic and user-friendly interface. Leveraging the capabilities of Google My Maps, we integrated mapping functionalities to enable users to easily locate dumpsters in their vicinity. Additionally, our team employed the PHP to handle the form submission processes in the contact section.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge that we ran into was our limited access to technology. My brother and I shared single computer to execute the various software downloads and installations necessary to create the site.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to create a website with such a user-friendly interface. It looks pretty nice!!

## What we learned
This was our first time using PHP. Previously, we would use Formspree. Now we know that PHP is very easy to use!
